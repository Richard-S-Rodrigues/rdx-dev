<h2 align='center'>A statically generated blog using Next.js and Markdown</h2>

I made this personal blog to write about things i learn as a software developer.

The blog posts are stored in `src/_posts` as Markdown files. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.

The images is stored in `public/static/images/blog`, inside specific directories for each post.
